# Hello,
In this repository I have published a program that can get the value of precious metals in real time. You can also enter a certain weight and get the price of the metal, or convert EUR to USD or GBP.

## The idea
This idea of doing this program started from a famous Netflix series: Money Heist. I thought: how much are 90 tons of gold worth in euros? So I decided to do this program. At the moment 90 tons of gold are ≃ 4,753,089,211€. Wow a lot of money :flushed:
